\begin_layout Opening
To the whom it may concern,

\begin_layout Standard
I am writing to apply to the Nuclear Engineer 4 position at NuScale Power.
 I am very passionate about the mission of using nuclear technology for
 peaceful applications in both the power and non-power sector, and NuScale's
 contributions to the nuclear power sector make working for NuScale extremely
 interesting to me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The research I will be presenting for my upcoming PhD defense is on the
 use of novel neutron detectors - Tensioned Metastable Fluid Detectors -
 in passive and active interrogation for special nuclear material interdiction.
 I've successfully implemented three different active interrogation methods
 with the detectors - differential die away analysis, interrogation of cargo
 for photofission, and threshold energy neutron analysis.
 These implementations required a largely intergrated approach, with me
 planning proof of concept experiments, designing and implementing detector
 changes to fit the needs of the method, building or otherwise preparing
 the interrogation system, and leading a team of up to 6 graduate researchers
 in the experiments themselves.
 I have also done data analysis of the detection space using MCNP6 and MCNPX-Pol
imi simulation of the method, and even ORIGEN estimate of radon and other
 contamination.
 The detectors recently won the best demo award at the 2016 IEEE Sensors
 conference.
 I have also received awards for the applications of the system and my analysis
 of those, particularly the best paper at the 2016 American Nuclear Society
 Winter Meeting for my paper analyzing threshold energy neutron analysis
 for highly enriched uranium and the 2017 Innovations in Nuclear Technology
 R&D Award for the same methodology.
 Before my current research, I performed more simulation and computational
 science work.
 I earned a

 concentration on my MSNE by developing a finite element model of our acoustical
ly run neutron detector.
 The work won me an award at the 2015 International Conference on Nuclear
 Engineering in Prague for my validation and verification technique of our
 detectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While much of the research I've done is not in the power sector, I have
 experience working in a national lab in a reactor physics context.
 I worked in a high performance computing environment at Argonne National
 Laboratory for a summer internship, using MC2 and VARIANT to validate fast
 reactor simulations.
 This was done in support of the NEAMES project for liquid sodium reactors.
 I was able to perform these computations on high performance computing
 resources, ultimately on Blue Gene P.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the simulation and mechanical design of detector systems are not
 the only capabilities that I have.
 I am proud of my data analytics and software/algorithm development skills
 as well.
 Besides the computation inherent in my publications, I also maintain several
 open source codes.
 Of particular interest to the reviewer may be my wrapper, analysis package
 and visualizer for the nuclear transport code MCNP that I call 
\emph on
wig
\emph default
.
 I also maintain a data analysis library that I call 
\emph on
PyM
\emph default
 and a visualization module I call 
\emph on
PyG
\emph default

, all written in Python, documented and published via Github.
 I highlight these to show that I have diversified my skillset so that I
 can take part in all levels of engineering and design of systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coupled with the above mentioned technical skills, I also strive to be an
 adept communicator and leader.
 My publication history is highlighted in part on my resume, showing my
 ability to communicate to technical audiences.
 I have several leadership roles listed on my resume as well, and between
 the Graduate Senate, Nuclear Engineering Graduate Organization, and Club
 Soccer roles, I have shown that I can lead in a technical and non-technical
 context.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hope to have the opportunity to contribute to NuScale through a position
 in the Nuclear Engineer 4 role.
