\begin_layout Opening
Sir/Madam,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am writing to apply to the position of Research Engineer at Lockheed Martin's
 Advanced Technology Center in Littleton Colorado.
 I'm particularly interested in applying to Lockheed Martin's ATC because
 its mission aligns very well with my skills: I feel particularly edified
 when providing a robust, real world solution to complex scientific and
 technical problems.
 I also write to point out how I would be valuatble to teams working on
 sensor fusion and filtering, firmware and real time controls, and to point
 out my experience with modeling and simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The research I will be presenting for my upcoming PhD defense is on the
 use of novel neutron detectors - Tensioned Metastable Fluid Detectors -
 in passive and active interrogation for special nuclear material interdiction.
 I've successfully implemented three different active interrogation methods
 with the detectors - differential die away analysis, interrogation of cargo
 for photofission, and threshold energy neutron analysis.
 The detectors - which I had a had a majority hand in designing the mechanical
 systems, electrical systems, writing of the firmware, and control software
 - recently won the best demo award at the 2016 IEEE Sensors conference.
 I have also received awards for the use of the data and filtering of the
 data from these systems, particularly the best paper at the 2016 American
 Nuclear Society Winter Meeting for my paper analyzing threshold energy
 neutron analysis for highly enriched uranium and the 2017 Innovations in
 Nuclear Technology R&D Award for the same methodology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before my current research, I performed more simulation and computational
 science work.
 I earned a

 concentration on my MSNE by developing a finite element model of our acoustical
ly run neutron detector.
 I developed a multiphysics model using the PDE solver COMSOL and verified
 the model using a laser based interrogation technique.
 I also was able to verify the thermoacoustics of the system - the sensitivity
 changes with temperature - and that has lead to much more robustness in
 the entire system.
 The work won me an award at the 2015 International Conference on Nuclear
 Engineering in Prague for my validation and verification technique of our
 detectors.
 Before that, I worked in a high performance computing environment at Argonne
 National Laboratory for a summer internship, using MC2 and VARIANT to validate
 fast reactor simulations.
 I was able to perform these computations on high performance computing
 resources, ultimately on Blue Gene P.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I also have experience working with real time controls in two regards.
 Recently, I developed a new methodology for detection of our neutron events.
 This method increased the timing resolution to the point that we could
 start to take acoustic spectrograms of the events.
 This capability so far has lead to the putative ability to discriminate
 alpha type events from neutron type events - an ability that can help in
 the detection of dark matter.
 I've also been able to develop a system for controlling the microsecond
 pulses of a DT neutron generator and sync this to our detector system,
 allowing for the ability to discriminate dangerous special nuclear material
 from inoccuous lowly enriched uranium.
 These are just two of the real time control systems I was able to develop
 during my graduate career.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is with these skills that I hope to contribute to Lockheed Martin's Advanced
 Technology Center by helping a team working on sensor fusion and filtering,
 firmware and realtime controls, or modeling and simulation.
