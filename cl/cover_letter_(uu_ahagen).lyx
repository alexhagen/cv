\begin_layout Opening
Sir/Madam,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am writing to apply to University of Utah for a position as an Assistant
 Professor in Nuclear Engineering.
 I am very interested in Utah because of the department's prestige, my research'
s relation to the stated desire nuclear detection and nuclear security,
 and location.
 I hope to describe my research and background in relation to have a chance
 to discuss my application packet verbally with the selection committee.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My previous research has developed a passion in me for the detection and
 interdiction of special nuclear material - counter-nuclear terrorism.
 The crux of our research basis is the thermodynamic oddity of negative
 pressure metastability and the ability of neutrons to create cavitations
 in these metastable fluids.
 This research is primarily interdisciplinary, although its applications
 are decidedly nuclear.
 The research sees as much inquiry into fluid mechanics and thermodynamics
 - not to mention rotordynamics, acoustics, and mechatronics - as it does
 into nuclear particle transport and nuclear interactions.
 The mechanical side of this research has always fascinated me, in fact
 the system - for which I designed from glassblowing to safety enclosure,
 simulated for rotordynamic stability, and created control electronics,
 firmware, and software - recently won the best demo award at the 2016 IEEE
 Sensors conference.
 The majority of my success, however, has come in the nuclear security applicati
ons of these detectors.
 I've successfully implemented three different active interrogation methods
 with the detectors - differential die away analysis, interrogation of cargo
 for photofission, and threshold energy neutron analysis; I won the best
 paper at the 2016 American Nuclear Society Winter Meeting for my paper
 analyzing threshold energy neutron analysis for highly enriched uranium
 and the 2017 Innovations in Nuclear Technology R&D Award for the same methodolo
gy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before my current research, I performed simulation and computational science
 work.
 I earned a

 concentration on my MSNE by developing a finite element model of our acoustical
ly run neutron detector.
 The work won me an award at the 2015 International Conference on Nuclear
 Engineering in Prague for my validation and verification technique of our
 detectors.
 Before that, I worked in a high performance computing environment at Argonne
 National Laboratory for a summer internship, using MC2 and VARIANT to validate
 fast reactor simulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, I do not apply to Utah as a research zealot.
 I often lament those faculty members that neglect their teaching duties,
 and am committed to teaching as an equal share of my role as a faculty
 member.
 I personally enjoy teaching, and while my methods may not be altogether
 conventional, they have gotten me some recognition within our department
 - I recieved the majority of votes for our teaching award for my work in
 a class on particle interactions.
 It is part of my personal mission to provide the best quality education
 to students that I would have wanted to receive as a student - a close
 friend always needles me to write down what I don't like, so that I can
 change it when I'm in that positions.
 I have written about these concerns and my teaching philosophy separately
 in my research statement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to my research and teaching interests, I'm particularly interested
 in Utah because of the greater community and the engagment opportunities
 it affords.
 I've always felt an interest in volunteering and community service - culminatin
g in me representing Nuclear Engineering to the Purdue Graduate Senate and
 running the official Purdue Graduate School volunteerism committee, amongst
 other smaller projects.
 I've been involved in soccer since I was 3 years old, and remain so.
 I was the president of Purdue's Club soccer team (Purdue does not have
 varsity men's soccer) and would look to be engaged in any soccer activity
 at Utah or in Salt Lake City itself.
 I'm also a dedicated trail runner - as much as one can be in Indiana -
 and have heard great things about the vibrant trail-running community in
 the Wasatch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all, I believe through my research and teaching, I could be an asset
 to Utah; and I'm interested in getting involved in the Utah and greater
 community with a view of making all of these better by my presence.
