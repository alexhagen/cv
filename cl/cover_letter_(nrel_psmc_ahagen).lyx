\begin_layout Opening
Sir/Madam,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'll be honest in this cover letter: I am trying to pivot from my current
 field to work towards more impactful ventures.
 I currently am finishing a PhD in Nuclear Engineering, with a focus on
 the interdiction of special nuclear materials.
 But, I've always thought that I'd spend my life making good things, instead
 of spend it stopping bad things.
 That is why I'm applying for the Power Systems Modeling and Control position.
 It seems to me that energy and energy availability is a source of human
 prosperity, and I am passionate about getting involved in it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The job description calls for an innovative and adaptable engineer, and
 I will attempt to highlight how I can be both of those things.
 The job description then also describes modeling methodologies and capabilities
 needed by the engineer, and I will touch on how I can fulfill those requirement
s.
 I hope I can show how I would be an asset to NREL in this capacity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My entire career thus far has been about adaptability as an engineer.
 I have moved from working as an industrial designer during my undergraduate
 education, to performing simulations in a high performance computing environmen
t at Argonne National Laboratory.
 I then received a masters (with a computational science concentration)
 on performing a multiphysics acoustic-piezoelectric simulation, before
 focusing on DHS funded experimental work for my dissertation.
 And that says nothing of the breadth of fields this work has been in.
 My work at Argonne National Laboratory focused on reactor physics for a
 power reactor, whereas my thesis and dissertation focus on a detector that
 uses thermodynamic fluid processes to detect neutrons.
 I would count myself quite competent at mechanical design, particle transport
 simulation, acoustics, finite element simulation, electrical design; however
 I have required many other skills during my career.
 I also consider myself a proficient software engineer - I have developed
 many data analysis code packages and maintain these currently.
 I find myself in discussions with other engineers quite often where my
 breadth of experience and skills is helpful to them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I also have shown innovation throughout my career.
 The problem of interdiction of special nuclear material is a difficult
 one, and current detectors do a bad job of solving the problem.
 I have been working on developing methodologies that might be able to circumven
t the problems with conventional detectors.
 This is a research topic that requires considerations ranging from the
 highly technical, such as the directionally dependent flux of a deuteron-deuter
on fusion reaction, to the mundane, such as the noise level of a detector
 system put in a shipping portal.
 The problem has challenged me to come up with and prove the concept of
 four methodologies for interdiction, a real practice in innovation and
 brainstorming.
 One methodology of mine, using a 
\begin_inset Formula $d+d$

 neutron generator and a panel of our detectors, won me both the ANS Young
 Members' Group best paper award in 2016 and the Department of Energy's
 Innovation in Nuclear Technology R&D award in 2017.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I also find myself well suited to the listed requirements for new modeling
 capabilities for power systems and for conducting simulation and laboratory
 testing.
 My nuclear engineering background has given me a strong base knowledge
 in the energy sector, in fact I've taken additional classes focusing on
 fuel cells, direct energy transfer technologies, and simulation for fusion
 energy.
 My experimental and simulation background has also given me a background
 in hardware-in-the-loop simulations, as well as energy transmission and
 system control experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I know that my experience will take some real consideration to fit into
 the job description for a Power Systems Modeling and Control engineer,
 but I believe that I could be a great asset to NREL in this regard.
 I hope I will get the chance to meet with the team and figure out how I
 can best help work towards the great mission of NREL.
