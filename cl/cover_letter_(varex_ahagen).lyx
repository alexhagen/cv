\begin_layout Opening
Sir/Madam,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am writing to apply to the R&D Engineer position for Varex Imaging.
 I'm actually very excited to apply to Varex for this job because I know
 how impactful medicine and medical imaging can be.
 While my degrees are in Nuclear Engineering, I come from a family with
 a focus of medicine - my father is a surgeon and my sister a biomedical
 engineer - and know how fulfilling they find their careers.
 I've also done several projects throughout my research that intersected
 with medical imaging: my senior design project used orthovoltage x-rays
 and x-ray screens to similarity scale direct energy transfer from a spent
 nuclear fuel pool, and part of my dissertation is a (as of yet unpublished)
 study into the neutron emission from a Varian Clinac 6Ex environment and
 further applications of that machine to homeland security.
 I hope that I will get a chance to discuss the R&D Engineer opportunity
 with you, as I 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

work with a borad range of technical backgrounds, ...and work through the rigors
 of R&D work,
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 as you describe.
 The remainder of this letter will describe my skills and achievements as
 they pertain to the R&D engineer listing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dissertation that I will defend in December 2017 is the culmination
 of more than 3 years of work since my MS, focused on particle accelerators
 in homeland security applications.
 For this work, I've improved and innovated on a novel neutron detector
 design - one that uses the thermodynamic oddity of negative pressure to
 detect nuclear particles.
 I've had the chance to be involved with all stages of this work: I personally
 do the CAD design of all parts of the detector in Solidworks and interface
 with the manufacturing of the detectors (in fact, I do some of the manufacturin
g myself); a colleague and I create the electronics and firmware that run
 the electro-mechanical systems; I use finite element software (COMSOL)
 to simulate aspects of the system including rotordynamics; and I use nuclear
 particle simulation to validate and verify against our data.
 The system itself has recently garnered attention, including the IEEE Sensors
 best demo award in 2016.
 In fact, I have been contracting on design with a commerical entity, Sagamore
 Adams Laboratory, that has driven this detector to market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But my research has not been limited to design and manufacturing of our
 own detectors.
 I have also used (and in some cases repaired) a 
\begin_inset Formula $d+d$
\end_inset

 neutron generator, a 
\begin_inset Formula $d+t$
\end_inset

 neutron generator, and a Varian Clinac 6Ex bremsstrahlung accelerator for
 applications in homeland security.
 Comparisons between our methods and conventional detectors has required
 the use and development of electronic trains of high voltage supplies,
 nuclear grade test equipment, and typical bench electronics.
 One methodology of mine, using a 
\begin_inset Formula $d+d$
\end_inset

 neutron generator and a panel of our detectors, won me both the ANS Young
 Members' Group best paper award in 2016 and the Department of Energy's
 Innovation in Nuclear Technology R&D award in 2017.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, a third facet of my research career has been my desire to simulate
 the experimental conditions in order to validate and verify continuously.
 I interned at Argonne National Laboratory on a project focused on bringing
 fast fission based nuclear reactors to market.
 My masters program included a concentration in computational science and
 involved simulation of an acoustic version of our neutron detector.
 The verification of this model won me the 2014 International Conference
 on Nuclear Engineering best poster award.
 As many computational scientists, I am active in software development and
 have skills in a broad array of languages.
 I maintain a data analysis library that I call 
\emph on
PyM
\emph default
 and a visualization module I call 
\emph on
PyG

\begin_layout Standard
I believe that with my diversified engineering skillset I would be a valuable
 addition to the great team at Varex and hope to get an opportunity to discuss
 the R&D Engineer opportunity.
