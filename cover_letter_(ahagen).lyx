\begin_layout Opening
To the application reviewer for the

software engineer

\end_inset

 position,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am writing to apply to ANSYS for the software engineer position.
 I am currently finishing my dissertation at Purdue University in Nuclear
 Engineering, doing work developing neutron detectors for national security
 purposes.
 My resume and application may be non-traditional, as my degree is not software
 oriented and my dissertation is experimentally focused, so I wanted to
 highlight a few things that I've done on the software engineering side
 of things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thesis I wrote for my master's degree was targeted toward simulation
 work, in fact earning me a 
\begin_inset Quotes sld
\end_inset

Computational Science in Engineering
\begin_inset Quotes srd
\end_inset

 concentration on that degree.
 I developed and validated a finite element model of our acoustically run
 neutron detector.
 The validation part of the work won me an award at the 2015 International
 Conference on Nuclear Engineering in Prague.
 During that work, I also was able to take a lot of coursework focusing
 on computational methods; a 681 mechanical engineering course on finite
 element method and boundary element method, and a 697 nuclear engineering
 course based on advanced simulation techniques for plasma physics were
 the pinacles of those plan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before that, I also had the good fortune to work in a high performance computing
 environment at Argonne National Laboratory for a summer undergraduate laborator
y internship.
 Although my work was in general supporting the principle investigators
 by simulating two reactors on legacy neutronics codes, I was able to perform
 these computations on largely parallel resources, ultimately on Blue Gene
 P - the state of the art machine at Argonne during that time (2011).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But besides the formal training I've received, I've also been active in
 development besides.
 My research has required me to run the line between data analyst, developer,
 and experimenter.
 I've been either primary or second in writing the firmware for the different
 types of detectors we are developing, with the detectors recently winning
 the best demo award at the 2016 IEEE sensors conference.
 I've also received awards for my data analysis and simulation work, particularl
y the best paper at the 2016 American Nuclear Society Winter Meeting.
 I highilight these awards to show my success at different types of computationa
l science and software/firmware development.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I also currently maintain many open source codes, generally written in Python.
 I'm particularly proud of a single-dimensional data analysis framework
 I have called 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "PyM"
target "https://alexhagen.github.io/pym"

\end_inset

; a data visualization module I've written named 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "PyG"
target "https://alexhagen.github.io/pyg"

\end_inset

; a set of classes in C++ for quicker development of our detector firmware
 called 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "cppm"
target "https://alexhagen.github.io/cppm"

\end_inset

; and a wrapper, visualizer, and analyzer for a nuclear particle transport
 code that I call 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "wig"
target "https://alexhagen.github.io/wig"

\end_inset

.
 I mention these for two reasons, to give you a chance to glance through
 their documentation to get an idea of my abilities, and because these four
 projects have helped me become adept at development.
 They've helped particularly in learning unit testing and version control,
 which are traits that I gather scientific programmers are usually below-par
 on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hope that I have helped highlight a few resume items that may help you
 decide my appropriateness for the software developer position opening.
 I hope to be able to interview and work with ANSYS.
