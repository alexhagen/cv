        <span class="major">Nuclear Engineering</span>
        <span class="university">Purdue University</span>
      </div>
			<p>Currently working on dissertation involving the use of active interrogation
      to detect and interdict nuclear material with TMFDs as the neutron (fission)
      detector. Pass qualification exams on general nuclear engineering,
      detection methods, material sciences, thermal hydraulics, and reactor
      theory (statics and dynamics of nuclear reactors).</p>
